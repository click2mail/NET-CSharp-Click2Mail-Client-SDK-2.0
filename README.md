# C#-Click2Mail-Client-SDK 2.0
This SDK makes it very easy to mail multiple (potentially 1000s) PDFs as a single batch upload. This reduces the upload time by orders of magnitude. You can take advantage of parallel batch processing to rapidly scale your mailings. Batch is also guaranteed to be monitored by C2M so any failures will be immediately caught and reported.

Please see this video for a walkthrough of the SDK, how to use it and options.
